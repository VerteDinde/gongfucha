## Summary

* CSS
* Javascript & jQuery
* Node
* Heroku & HerokuDB (deployment and database)
* Google Maps API

## Features

#### Maps location data
We use the Google Maps API to grab information about tea shops all over the world - however, that information is pulled from a database created by our users. Shops and houses can be found internationally - we accept new shops from the US, China, Taiwan, Europe and all over the world.

#### User-curated database
We want our users to identify and submit their own favorite tea shops, tea houses and tea plantations, rather than rely on information from Google. All of the tea locations in our database have been selected and submitted by users.

### Information on the best online retailers and tea shops.
We provide updated information on both where you can visit the best tea shops across the nation, and where you can fins the best deals for tea online.


## In Development
We are just getting started here. In the future, we will add:
* Google Places integration with our form.
* Photo gallery
* Review functionality
* List of tea blogs
* Database of tasting notes
